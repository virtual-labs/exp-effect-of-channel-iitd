    {
      "question": "Question 1: In a Rayleigh fading channel, what statistical property of the envelope causes deep signal fades?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "High average power of multipath components.",
        "b": "Zero mean of the in-phase and quadrature components.",
        "c": "Exponential decay of the amplitude envelope.",
        "d": "Constant phase rotation across paths."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "High power does not cause fades; it's the constructive/destructive combination.",
        "b": "Correct! Zero mean Gaussian components result in Rayleigh-distributed amplitude, causing deep fades.",
        "c": "This is more relevant in power-delay profiles, not envelope fading directly.",
        "d": "Phase rotations vary randomly and cause fading, but not 'constant' ones."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "difficulty": "hard"
    },
    {
      "question": "Question 2: Why does higher-order modulation (like 64-QAM) suffer more in Rayleigh fading than lower-order schemes (like BPSK)?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Because higher-order schemes require narrower bandwidths.",
        "b": "Because symbol spacing is smaller, making them more error-prone during fades.",
        "c": "Because they have lower average power.",
        "d": "Because they introduce non-linearity into the channel."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Bandwidth is not the core issue in fading.",
        "b": "Correct! Closer constellation points mean a small fade can easily cause incorrect demodulation.",
        "c": "Power is normalized; spacing is the issue.",
        "d": "Modulation schemes themselves don't cause non-linearity."

      "question": "Question 3: How does a frequency-selective Rayleigh fading channel affect an OFDM system compared to a flat-fading channel?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "All subcarriers experience equal gain and phase shifts.",
        "b": "Some subcarriers are severely attenuated while others are not.",
        "c": "It has no significant impact because OFDM uses cyclic prefixes.",
        "d": "It affects the bit duration rather than the frequency response."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "That describes flat fading.",
        "b": "Correct! Frequency-selective fading leads to variation across subcarriers.",
        "c": "Cyclic prefix prevents ISI but doesn't flatten the channel.",

        "b": "The carrier frequency selection.",
        "c": "The coherence time of the channel.",
        "d": "The baseband signal bandwidth."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "PAPR is a concern in OFDM but unrelated to Doppler directly.",
        "b": "Carrier frequency choice isn't significantly affected by Doppler spread.",
        "c": "Correct! Doppler spread inversely affects coherence time, leading to fast fading.",
        "d": "Bandwidth is not a direct consequence of mobility."

      "question": "Question 5: How does increasing diversity order affect the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of received SNR in Rayleigh fading?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The CDF shifts left, indicating more outage probability.",
        "b": "The CDF becomes more linear.",
        "c": "The tail of the CDF becomes steeper, reducing probability of deep fades.",
        "d": "The CDF becomes uniform."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Higher diversity reduces outage, not increases it.",
        "b": "CDF doesn't become linear; it's still exponential-like.",
        "c": "Correct! Diversity improves SNR statistics, making deep fades less likely.",
        "d": "CDF cannot be uniform in fading channels."

        "c": "Average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).",
        "d": "Outage probability at a target SNR threshold."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Instantaneous power fluctuates and is not a reliable predictor.",
        "b": "Es/N0 is useful, but doesn't account for fading variability.",
        "c": "Average SNR alone doesnâ€™t capture fading effects.",
        "d": "Correct! Outage probability accounts for both fading and noise over time."
